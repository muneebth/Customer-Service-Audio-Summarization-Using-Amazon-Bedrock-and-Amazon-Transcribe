# Customer Service Audio Summarization Using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Transcribe

This project provides a framework for converting audio from customer service calls into concise text summaries using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Transcribe. This process leverages these AWS services to transcribe audio into text, and subsequently, summarize the transcription to extract key insights such as sentiment analysis and potential customer issues. Below is an overview of how to utilize this notebook effectively.

## Steps

1. **Import Packages and Load the Audio File**
   - Begin by importing necessary Python packages.
   - Load the audio file you wish to transcribe and summarize.

2. **Setup AWS Clients**
   - **S3 Client**: Used for uploading and managing audio files in Amazon S3.
   - **Transcribe Client**: Utilized for converting the audio file to text using Amazon Transcribe.

3. **Upload Audio File to S3**
   - Store the audio file in an S3 bucket for processing.

4. **Create a Unique Job Name**
   - Generate a unique identifier for the transcription task to avoid conflicts and enable effective tracking.

5. **Build the Transcription Response**
   - Initiate the audio transcription job and handle responses to extract the text transcript.

6. **Access the Needed Part of the Transcript**
   - Retrieve specific sections of the transcript that are essential for a focused summary.

7. **Setup Bedrock Runtime**
   - Prepare the environment to utilize Amazon Bedrock's capabilities for text processing and summarization.

8. **Create a Prompt Template**
   - Develop templates to effectively prompt the summarization model. This ensures that output is focused on relevant issues and sentiment.

9. **Generate a Summary of the Audio Transcript**
   - Execute the summarization process using the template and environment setup, resulting in a concise summary of the transcribed call.

## Requirements
- Python environment with necessary packages installed (`boto3`, `jinja2`).
- AWS credentials configured for S3, Transcribe, and Bedrock services.
- Properly configured S3 bucket.

## How to Run
- Prepare your environment and ensure AWS services are accessible.
- Follow the steps sequentially in the notebook to process your audio file and generate a summary.

## Output
- The generated summary will provide sentiment analysis and highlight key issues discussed during the conversation.
- Results are extracted from the processed transcript and can be saved or utilized for further analysis.

By following these steps, you can efficiently extract meaningful insights from customer service interactions, enhancing understanding and improving service quality.
